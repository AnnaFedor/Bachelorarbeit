The entropy coefficient is going down as well because the agent does not need to do much exploration anymore. Policy loss is going to zero, as well as the losses from both Q-networks and the target value network, which means the weights of the network are adjusted in an optimal way to achieve success. \relax }}{25}{figure.caption.20}\protected@file@percent }
